# FFT-C-Implementation
 Implementation of Discrete Time Fourier Transform, Good-Thomas FFT and Cooley-Tukey FFT algorithms, originally done for UQ 4th Year Electrical Engineering course on Digital Signal Processing.

 Implemented in C and Matlab using dynamic memory. Will possibly rewrite with fixed memory sizes down the track.
